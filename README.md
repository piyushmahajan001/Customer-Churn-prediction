Churn prediction means detecting which customers are likely to cancel a subscription to a service based on how they use the service. It is a critical prediction for many businesses because acquiring new clients often costs more than retaining existing ones. Once you can identify those customers that are at risk of cancelling, you should know exactly what marketing action to take for each individual customer to maximise the chances that the customer will remain.

**Why is it so important?**

Customer churn is a common problem across businesses in many sectors. If you want to grow as a company, you have to invest in acquiring new clients. Every time a client leaves, it represents a significant investment lost. Both time and effort need to be channelled into replacing them. Being able to predict when a client is likely to leave, and offer them incentives to stay, can offer huge savings to a business.

**Steps involved in Model Deployment:**

* Data Analysis (EDA)
* Data Preprocessing.
* Feature Engineering.
* Feature Selection (SelectKBest)
* Fit into Algorithm (ML Algorithm)
* Hyper Parameter Tunning (RandomSearchCV)
* Dump model (Pickle)

**Packages Used:**

This project requires Python and the following packages are in below:

* [Numpy](https://numpy.org/)
* [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
* [Matplotlib](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
* [Seaborn](https://pandas.pydata.org/)

* [Counter](https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html)
  
**Objective:**

Predict the customer likely to be Churn or not by using Gradient Boost Classifier and target is to find customer to be Churn or Not.
